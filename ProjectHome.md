**Quick Notes** is an IDEA plugin that allows you to quickly manage notes within IDEA.

While working on a project, many a times you need to save some tips, notes, a code snippet, etc and opening up notepad and then writing to it and then saving it was just an annoying process and I needed a quick way to save my thoughts without leaving IDEA. First I looked into plugin repository to look for something I may use but didn't find anything so I wrote this plugin to manage my notes within IDEA. The first version was written in about an hour and allowed me to save only one note, which again didn't fulfill my need as many a times I want to keep multiple notes, so I wrote another version that allowed me to manage multiple notes and it went on and I kept adding more and more features to it. The current version is **2.7**.
